How to run GalaxSee

GalaxSee is designed to be run from a command line unix prompt. It solves 
for the collapse of a rotating group of objects bound by gravity. You can 
specify the number of masses, the mass per object, the running time for 
the model, and whether or not to visualize the results.

It is designed to be run as an MPI program. To get your MPI environment
going, run this command in a terminal:

$ bccd-snarfhosts -v

You will get output back that will look like this if you are using OpenMPI
(the default BCCD MPI implementation):

node011.bccd.net slots=2
node000 slots=2

Or like this, if you are using MPICH2:

node011.bccd.net:2
node000:2

In both cases, you have two slots on node000 and two on node011, for four
slots total.

You can verify which MPI implementation you have loaded with:

   $ bccd-get-mpi

This command will print "openmpi" if you have MPICH2 loaded, or "mpich2" if
you have OpenMPI loaded.

If you are using OpenMPI, use this command to run GalaxSee:

  $ cp ~/machines-openmpi machines
  $ mpirun -np 4 -machinefile machines ./GalaxSee.cxx-mpi 1000 500 400

If you are using MPICH2, use these commands to run GalaxSee:

  $ cp ~/machines-mpich2 machines
  $ mpirun -np 4 ./GalaxSee.cxx-mpi 1000 500 400

These commands assume a 4 node cluster running 1000 objects of 200 solar
masses each for 1000 Myears, displaying the results in an X window.
