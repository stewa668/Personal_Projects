This directory contains StatKit and petakit, the tools used to measure runtime
performance of parallel (or serial) software.  It can be used in a basic mode 
to record the runtime of a single invocation of a program, or in an advanced 
mode where StatKit will generate a paramater space over a given number of 
processes and/or problem sizes.

For more information see the documentation, PetaKit_BW_module.{tex, pdf}
