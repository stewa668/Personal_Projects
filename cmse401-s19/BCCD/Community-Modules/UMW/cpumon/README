LittleFe CPU Load Monitor Version 1.0

Description
The LittleFe CPU Load Monitoring software was designed to give a real time
display of the CPU utilization of each CPU core in the cluster. When the
application is started, it opens an X window with six graphs. Each graph
displays the CPU utilization for a node in the system. Since the LittleFe is
comprised of six nodes with a dual core processor in each node, the blue and
red colors on the graph denote the individual core information. The program
uses MPI to gather the data needed from each node every second. The information
is then used to update the graph on the display. Each graph holds the five most
recent values for each core's utilization. When a new utilization value is
added, the oldest value is bumped off the left edge of the graph. The data
points are connected with straight lines. "Core One's", lines are drawn in
Blue, while "Core Two's", line are drawn in red. Underneath each graph there is
a label for each of the cores. Next to these labels, the numerical value for
the core utilization is displayed in the appropriate color. To terminate the
program, click on the "X" box on the upper right hand of the display.

Using the CPU Monitor
To use the CPU monitor, you must first compile the source code file into a
binary file. Please note that the CPU Monitor software was designed to run with
all 6 nodes of the LittleFe powered up. It has not been tested with fewer than
6 nodes and we know that there will be problems if it runs with fewer than 6
nodes powered up.

Compiling the CPU Monitor Software
Type 'make' and hit the Enter key. That produces a binary file called
cpumonitor.

Creating the Hosts File
Run the 'bccd-snarfhosts' command.

Running the Program
To run the program, type
    mpirun -np 6 --bynode -machinefile ~/machines-openmpi cpumonitor
and hit the Enter key.
