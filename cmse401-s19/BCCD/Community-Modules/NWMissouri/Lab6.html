    <p>To submit this assignment, you may copy and paste the assignment
      into a text editor such as nano, vi, notepad, MS Word, OpenOffice
      Writer, etc.&nbsp; Zip the code and scripts showing the output of
      your solutions, and submit the zip file to the dropbox for lab
      6.&nbsp; The purpose of this lesson is to learn to about the
      threaded solution to the Producer Consumer problem in the C
      programming language.</p>
      <p>This assignment references Walker, R., COMP2030:
      Lab 2, August, 1996, <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/student/comp2030/Lab2.html">http://cs.anu.edu.au/student/comp2030/Lab2.html</a>, and Snir, M.,

    Part 1<br>
    <br>
    Unzip the threaded Producer-Consumer example from the examples page
    on LittleFe.&nbsp; The command to do so follows below:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip prodcons.zip<br>
    <br>
    If you are using a BCCD virtual machine, you will need to download
    zip and unzip with the following command:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo apt-get install zip unzip<br>
    <br>
    Then run:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unzip prodcons.zip<br>
    <br>
    First we will learn about makefiles.&nbsp; All the unzipped files
    should be in a directory called prod cons.&nbsp; There is a makefile
    included within the zip file. It is called makefile.pc.&nbsp; Browse
    the file using nano or another text editor.&nbsp; Compile all the
    files in the zip file using the following command:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make -f makefile.pc<br>
    <br>
    Run the Producer-Consumer project with the following command:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ./pc<br>
    <br>
    Part 2<br>
    <br>
    Modify the producer consumer project to use two producers and three
    consumers.<br>
    <br>
    Run the following command before compiling your code:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make -f makefile.pc clean<br>
    <br>
    This will remove the old object files from your directory.<br>
    <br>
    Compile your code and run it again to ensure it works.<br>
    <br>
    Save this code to submit it later.<br>
    <br>
    Part 3<br>
    <br>
    Follow the same steps from part 2, but ensure that your code will
    work for any number of producer and any number of consumers.&nbsp;
    You should read in the number of producers and the number of
    consumers from the keyboard.&nbsp; Ensure that your producers and
    consumers are identified by their thread id within your output.<br>
