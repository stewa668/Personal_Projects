      _____________________________________________ </p>
    <p>To submit this assignment, you
      may copy and paste the assignment into a text editor such as nano,
      vi, notepad, MS Word, OpenOffice Writer, etc.&nbsp; Zip the code
      and scripts showing the output of your solutions, and submit the
      zip file to the dropbox for lab 5.&nbsp; The purpose of this
      lesson is to learn to about load balancing and parallel
      programming
      using Threads and MPI Message Passing
      (also known as Interprocess Communication) in the C programming
      language.</p>

      </p>
    <p>1. Download the code at this <a
        href="serialMonteCarloPIGenerator.zip">link</a>.&nbsp; This code
      computes PI using a Monte Carlo technique.&nbsp; PI is computed by
      finding the proportion of the number of samples that fall within a
      circle that is circumscribed within a square to the number of
      total samples.&nbsp; Convert the file circle.c to evenly divide
      the work between any number of pThreads.&nbsp; You may read in the
      number of samples of threads using scanf.&nbsp; You may assume
      that the number of samples can be evenly divided by the number of
      threads.&nbsp; Turn in a copy of your code.&nbsp; You can compile
      the code from the zip file as follows:<br>
      <br>
      <font face="Courier New">gcc mt19937-64.c circle.c -o circle.exe</font><br>
    </p>
    <p>2. Save your code from problem 1.&nbsp; Make a copy of it.&nbsp;
      Convert this code to work with any number of processes in C/MPI
      using non-blocking sending and receiving to complete your
      work.&nbsp; One process should act as the server and should
      receive and accumulate all the data from worker processes that
      will perform computations.&nbsp; You should read in the number of
      samples from the command line in the same manner as you did in
      Project 2.&nbsp; You may assume that the number of samples can be
      evenly divided by the number of processes. Turn in a copy of your
      code.&nbsp; After writing your code, you can compile it as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      <font face="Courier New">mpicc mt19937-64.c circle.c -o circle.exe</font><br>
      <br>
      3. Write a batch script for your code and run it on
      Stampede.&nbsp; Turn in a copy of your batch script and your
      output file.&nbsp; Try using a large sample size and a high core
      count like 12,700,000,000 samples and 128 cores (remember that 1
      core will be used for the server process).<br>
    </p>
    4. Convert the fixed race condition (the one using semaphores)
    program to work with any number of incrementers and
    decrementers.&nbsp; You may assume that the number of incrementers
    and decrementers is the same and that it is read in from the
    keyboard.<br>
