This directory contains a pre-built versions of NAMD, the molecular dynamics 
program built by the Beckman Institute at UIUC.  The tutorials to use with 
NAMD can be found here: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/#namd

The NAMD_2.9_Linux-x86_64-MPI directory contains binaries that are only built
with MPI.  NAMD_2.9_Linux-x86_64-MPI-CUDA contains binaries built with both 
CUDA and MPI.

This directory also contains Mindy, the very simple serial molecular dynamics 
program also produced by the Beckman Institute and brought up to modern 
standards by the BCCD project.  It's designed for learning about MD, not for 
doing production work.

Both programs contain example molecular systems which can be simulated and 
analyzed.
