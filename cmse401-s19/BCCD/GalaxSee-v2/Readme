N-Body Problems: GalaxSee-v2

One of the grand challenge problems in astronomy is the evolution and structure
of the universe and galaxies. The universe is seen to have a structure of sheets
and voids on a large scale. Galaxies are seen to often have a spiral structure
that is difficult to explain. Space is not occupied by a homogeneous fluid, but
by discrete particles that interact through gravity over long ranges. The N-body
problem is the problem of predicting the motion of a group of celestial objects
that interact with each other with respect to gravity.

The N-Body problem is a problem in which more than 2 particles interact in such
a way that every particle has the potential to interact with every other
particle in a meaningful way. Typically this is defined to be any problem where
you expect to see forces acting at a distance, such as gravitational
interactions on astronomical spatial scales, or electroweak interactions on
molecular spatial scales. The characteristics of the N-Body problem are that it
has historically pushed the boundaries of our ability to handle both large
computational problems and chaotic computational problems. BCCD Comes with two
flavor or N-body problems, GalaxSee and GalaxSee-v2.

GalaxSee-v2:

GalaxSee-v2 is a computer code written to solve the N-Body problem for Newtonian
gravity, studying problems such as orbital motion of satellites, moons, comets
and planets; the collapse due to gravity and structure of clusters of stars and
of galaxies; and the collapse of cold dark matter into the sheets and voids that
make up the large scale structure of the universe. The source code for
GalaxSeeHPC requires a unix-like environment, such as MacOS X, Linux, or the
Cygwin environment for Windows users. You will also need a C compiler, and a
working copy of "make". Additional libraries which are not required to use
GalaxSeeHPC, but can extend the number of features available include the ability
to display X11 graphics (top-down and side view) and to compile against the X11
development libraries for basic X11 display; GD libraries to create snapshots in
jpg format (top-down and side-view); OpenGL, SDL, and pthreads for interactive
graphics with perspective; and FFTW3 for the ability to use
Particle-Particle-Particle-Mesh force calculation along with periodic boundary
conditions. If you do not have these features on your system, you can disable
them in make before compiling the code.

For More information See:
  GalaxSee HPC Module 1.docx
  GalaxSee HPC 1.1 Manual.docx
  GalaxSee HPC Module 2.docx

How to Build and Run:
  $ make

  Now to run the program on one node of your cluster, enter the following command:
  $ time mpirun -np 1 -machinefile ~/machines ./galaxsee.mpi simple.gal

  Notes: simple.gal is an input file. For More options uncomment the necessary
  options either in the simple.gal file, or if running with FFTW, NetCDF, SLD,
  Gadgate2, using the appropriate input files present in the GalaxSee-v2
  directory.
