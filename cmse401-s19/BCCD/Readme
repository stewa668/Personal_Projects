This is the home directory of the bccd user.  Each directory contains an
module which illustrates one or more forms of parallel and/or distributed
computing.  

1) Modules contained in this directory: 

  Area-under-curve
  CUDA
  GalaxSee
  GalaxSee-v2
  HPL-benchmark
  Hello-world
  Life
  Molecular-dynamics
  Pandemic 
  Parameter-space
  Sieve
  StatKit
  Tests
  Tree-sort

2) Instructions for building and running:

There is a tree directory structure for building and running our modules.
The top-level Makefile in ~bccd (this directory) includes all the necessary
CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LIBS, targets, and dependencies.  To build all the modules
type "$ make build-all" in the terminal. This will recurse into each of the
directories listed above and invokes make there.  To clean all created
binaries type "make clean-all" in the terminal.

The Makefile structure supports the following options:
  NO_X11=1 to the make command line to omit X libraries.
  DEBUG=1 to add -ggdb to CFLAGS
  PROFILE=1 to add -pg to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
  STAT_KIT=1 to enable StatKit
  
These are added on the make command line like so:
  $ make build-all STAT_KIT=1
  
The makefiles in each of the module directories support the same syntax 
and options.
