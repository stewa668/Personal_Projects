This directory contains the testing framework and tests for the BCCD.  
For more information see the source code.


The BCCD Test Suite utilizes comparative testing. It runs its tests and compares 
them against the results they had in a distribution / environment already known to work. 
These  known good results are referred to as the "control." 

If you do not have a directory "control" with the control results of the tests in 
your ~bccd/tests folder, (if you're an end user you should) you can generate one on a 
known good machine with the -c predicate:

How to run:
In either terminal, run 
$ perl bccd_test_suite.pl -c --mail --mailto you@yourdomain.com

How to Add more tests:

Adding new tests has never been simpler:

	1. Write a script in your favorite language.

		- Make sure it knows what parser to use when executed (get to know #! ("shebang" if you 
want to Google it) if you're not already acquainted)

		- Take a look to see if a similar test already exists to avoid duplicated effort (see Note)

	2. Save it in ~bccd/tests/scripts

	3. If your script is not a test, but a diagnostic for relevant system data, drop it in 
	the "system" subdirectory
		- "system" tests are not included in control generation, and are always included in 
		reports, even reports of success

Note: There is a hidden subdirectory in the scripts directory .sharedcode. It is in 
this directory that you should put the code shared by multiple tests. For instance, 
the MPI tests all use the same general format and therefore are mostly handled by the 
perlshared.pm module file in the .sharedcode directory.

Current Tests and scripts:

Test				|	Script	
Gromacs			| gromacs.pl	
R						|	r.pl			 		
GalaxSee		|	mpitest.sh	
Life				|	mpitest.sh	
Param-Space	|	mpitest.sh	
PSC_DX			|	NA	

Test Needed to be added (Todo List):
	
	0- fix and test the issues with ~/../scripts/shared_code/perl_shared.pm
	0a- fix test_defs.pm 

	1- Automation 
		- automate the testing process (More info-coming soon).

	2. create new test for all the remaining BCCD Modules

	3. Documentation

	4. Liberation test is not working - need to be completed

	5. compilers/libraries/packages test

	6. etc

	7. bccd functionality

--=--ToDo List:
- Live Mode:
	- Test for all the Modules
	- Test for Software Modules
	- Test for etc..
- Liberated Mode:
	- Test for all the Modules
	- Test for Liberations 
	- Test for software Modules
