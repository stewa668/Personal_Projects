# magma is a GPU enabled lapack library
# to use, ensure  CUDA/5.0 library loaded 

(1) Table of content

README: This file.
Source code:
    dgesv_gpu.cpp
    flops.h
    testings.h
    testing_util.cpp
Makefile: for build the executable.
run.qsub: job script for summiting to batch queue.

(2) To run the program interactively

NOTE: make sure that you are on a node that have GPU card.
For example, dev-intel14-k20 or dev-intel16-k80 or any compute
node from "qsub -I -l nodes=1:ppn=1:gpus=1,mem=1GB,walltime=10:00,feature=gpgpu"

# loading magma (both versions of MAGAM are tested)

module purge
module load GCC/6.4.0-2.28  OpenMPI/2.1.2        
module load magma/2.3.0-CUDA-9.1.85 imkl/2018.1.163

# build:

make clean
make

# run:

To see the help:
./dgesv_gpu.exe -h

To run with all default setting
./dgesv_gpu.exe

(2) Run in batch
sbatch run.qsub
