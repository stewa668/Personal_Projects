Instructions for running on HPCC

1) Run simple_make (Will hopefully load all necessary modules for you.)

    bash ./simple_make

2) Run the code.

   ./WF.o

3) Can also time it with this.

    time ./WF.o

WF.dat will be created, which gives the array of the last y values.

By modifying WF.f90, you can easilly get more more y-values from different times, though the file can be quite large.
