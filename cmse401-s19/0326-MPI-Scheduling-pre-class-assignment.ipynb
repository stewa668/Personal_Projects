    "Based on my reading of this document I think the terms can be grouped into two different ways to abstract the problem.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware abstraction\n",
    "* **node** - A physical computing system that shares a common memory address space.  A node may have more than one socket and a socket may have multiple cores. However, all the cores on a single node would share the same memory space. \n",
    "* **sockets** - A physical socket that a CPU chip would be put in.  There can be multiple sockets per node.\n",
    "* **cores** - Independent computing cores. There are typically multiple cores per socket. \n",
    "* **threads** - Independent programming threads that can be run on a single core or different cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program abstraction\n",
    "* **job** - A set of commands controlled by the scheduler. Each job is given a different unique identifier.\n",
    "* **task** - A discrete piece of work being distributed by a \"job\" typically related to a thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a dizzying number of SLURM options relate to how jobs map programs onto hardware. Some of them include:\n",

    "Early in the semester I suggested using the following syntax for scheduling MPI jobs across the cluster:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1\n",
    "#SBATCH --nodes=7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I think this recommendation is wrong. With these two options each job runs on seven different node and are allocated only one core per node.  This is not quite the way we want to run MPI jobs.  It is generally better to run multiple cores on a single node because MPI communication will be faster between the cores.  One option would be to request all seven cores on the same node:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#SBATCH -nodes=1\n",
    "#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not quite right either. This option would only scale to the largest node.  This job is also much harder to schedule because the scheduler would have to wait for all seven cores to be available on a single node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we want to provide flexibility to the scheduler so the job will start as soon as cores are available anywhere on the system.  For example, to we don't care if we schedule 7 tasks on 1 node or 7 nodes. "
